<p>A set of rollable tables and supporting drag-and-drop items that allow a player to quickly randomize and build a character. This module is dependent on the Stormlight Handbook premium module for drag-and-drop content.</p>
<p>In the current version, the resulting character will only lack the four assignable skill points, purpose and obstacle, and additional expertises from their Intellect to qualify as a complete Level One character for the Stormlight setting.</p>

This module is a Foundry implementation of a set of tables made to be used with a regular Cosmere RPG polyhedral dice set.

INSTRUCTIONS: Roll one of every die: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and the plot die.
  The top left corner of each table tells you which die selects from that table.
  
  The d12 provides your starting path. 
  The d12 and d4 together provide one set of attributes and second key talent if the d10 reads 7.
  Attributes are ordered "STR SPD - INT WIL - AWA PRE". Key talents are the first letter of the path.
  The d10 provides your ancestry and the associated talent: human on 1-7, singer on 8-10.
  
  The d20 provides one of your starting cultures: your nationality.
  The d20 and plot die together provide your other starting culture from one of the other three columns.
